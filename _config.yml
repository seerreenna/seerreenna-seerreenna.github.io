  Hi! I'm Serena, a Data Scientist based in Irvine, CA with experience in the Defense, Technology, and Food Distribution industries. I enjoy piecing together small bits of information to gain a better perspective on the world at large. My favorite areas to analyze are Technology, Sports, and International Relations.
